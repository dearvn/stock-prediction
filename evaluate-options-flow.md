**Steps for Analysis:**

1. **Identify Market Range:**

   * I'll calculate the expected high and low price movement based on the options data.

   * I'll use delta, open interest, and volume to gauge the potential volatility.

2. **Assess Strength of Movement:**

   * I'll compare implied volatility, delta, and bid-ask spreads to determine if the movement is strong, mid, or weak.

3. **Find Best OTM Options to Trade:**

   * For a **call option**, I'll find a strike price slightly above the current price with strong open interest and volume.

   * For a **put option**, I'll find a strike price below the current price with strong open interest and volume.

I'll now process the image data to extract key values and provide recommendations.

From the extracted options chain data, I'll now analyze the total market range movement, categorize the movement's strength, and recommend the best OTM call and put option strike prices.
