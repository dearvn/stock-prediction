# SPX Options Trading Strategy

## Overview
This strategy leverages **AI predictions**, the **Martingale method**, and **Iron Condor** to trade SPX options efficiently. By analyzing market trends, the AI predicts potential movements, allowing for strategic entries and exits to maximize profitability while managing risk.

## Strategy Components
### 1. **AI Market Prediction**
- AI analyzes market trends and volatility to predict direction.
- Predictions are generated daily at **12:55 PM (before market close)**.
- Based on the forecast, options positions are structured accordingly.

### 2. **Martingale Method**
- If the initial trade results in a loss, the position size is doubled to recover losses in subsequent trades.
- Risk is managed by setting a **50% stop-loss** at each step.
- Implementation:
  - **Day 1:** Buy 1 CALL & 1 PUT ($1,000 each, total $2,000). If loss = **-$1,000**.
  - **Day 2:** Double to 2 CALLs & 2 PUTs ($4,000 total). If loss = **-$2,000**.
  - **Day 3:** Double again to 4 CALLs & 4 PUTs ($8,000 total). If loss = **-$4,000**.
  - If market moves strongly, potential profit is **100%+**.

### 3. **Iron Condor for Stability**
- Used when AI predicts a **sideways market**.
- Sell an Iron Condor with short strikes near expected price range.
- Generates **premium income** while limiting risk.
- Profits from low volatility conditions.

## Trade Execution
- **Entry:** 12:57 PM (before market close)
- **Exit:** Before 7:30 AM (market open next day)
- **Option Expiration:** Next day
- **Price Limit:** â‰¤ $10 per contract
- **Minimum Capital Required:** $14K+

## Risk Management
- **Stop-loss:** 50% per trade
- **Diversification:** Mix of directional trades (Martingale) and neutral trades (Iron Condor)
- **AI Adjustment:** AI adapts predictions based on new data

## Expected Outcomes
### **Best-Case Scenario (Strong Market Movement)**
- At least **100% profit** on directional trades.
- Iron Condor expires worthless, keeping premium.

### **Worst-Case Scenario (Sideways Market)**
- Directional trades incur losses up to $4,000.
